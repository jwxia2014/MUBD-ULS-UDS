# A Brief Introduction to ULS/UDS

1. ULS/UDS is the first series of maximal unbiased benchmarking datasets that created by MUBD-DecoyMaker 1.0, a Pipeline Pilot-based computational tool developed by our lab. ULS/UDS has been compared with GLL/GDD and is less biased in evalution of virtual screening approaches. ULS/UDS proves the rational of our algorithm and the robustness of our computational tool. 

2. ULS/UDS is composed of 17 datasets for GPCR targets. 

3. ULS/UDS is easily accessible by downloading all the files here and unzipping them.
